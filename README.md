## Inventory Management System

* This simple inventory management system is written in python. You can read, input, edit or delete any inventory items easily.

* The default variables of the inventory items are "ID", "Quantity" and "Date". You can easily modify the code to include more details.

* The inventory data will be stored in a dictionary, which will later be saved into a txt file. You don't need to connect to a specific database to run the script.
